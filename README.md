**ProjectBasedLearning_Java**
Welcome to the ProjectBasedLearning_Java repository! This collection contains projects I've implemented as part of my learning journey in Java. As I am just starting out, these projects focus on building a strong foundation in Java programming and data structures by applying concepts through practical examples.

**Repository Overview**
This repository documents my early steps in learning Java through project-based learning. It includes simple yet meaningful projects that cover Java fundamentals and essential data structures like arrays and stacks. As I progress, I will continue adding more complex projects and refining my understanding of core programming concepts.

**Key Projects**
Array Fundamentals: Introduction to arrays and basic operations, alongside simple DSA problems.
Sorting Algorithms: Early attempts at implementing basic sorting techniques such as Bubble Sort.
Stack Fundamentals: My exploration of stack data structures, with implementations of push, pop, and peek operations.

**Goals**
Since I'm just starting my learning journey, the primary goal of this repository is to track my progress and build a solid understanding of Java fundamentals. Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome!
